# Math game

In this game, the player can select a game (addition/subtraction/product/division). The game then gives the player math-questions of the selected type.
The player can view previous games, saved to a SQLite database.
The app has a graphical UI made with .NET maui.

## Purpose

I made this app to learn creating multi-platform apps with .NET maui.
